Github Assignment #1

Introduction
This assignment is meant to be a warm up so that students can ensure they know how to work with git and so that they can understand how the AP CS problem grader works. We are assigned to write 4 class methods that do what the instruction want it to do.

Specification

This fulfilled all the specification from the instruction because it returns what the instructions want to return.

Errors

There is no error in this code.

Structure

There are 4 class methods in the main file called Intro.java (one class method for each problem).  The first problem wants us to create a method called ret. It takes no argument and return 17. The second problem wants us to create a method called logic that takes in three parameters, and returns the logical “and” of the parameters together (find and return the “value of a and b and c”). The third problem wants us to write a method called stars. It involves printing a left-justified triangle using the * character.  For example, if the function gets the input 5, the output would be:

*
**
***
****
*****
The fourth problem wants us to write a method called coins that returns the minimum number of 5 and 2 in a number; if the number cannot fully break to 2s and 5s return -1.

Major Challenges
The major challenge that I encountered in the process of making code is the fourth problem because I need to find the remainder when the integer n is divided by 5. And it also have different situations to decide. I found out that modular(%) work for finding the remainder and make an if and else if statement for different kinds of situation.

Acknowledgement  

I did not ask for any help.
